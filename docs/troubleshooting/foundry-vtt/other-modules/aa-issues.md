### I can't get rid of the animation

> It might be an overhead tile, a Sequencer Effect or a corrupted flag. 
> Check in this order: 
> 1. Click on the Tile control tool, then on the house icon (for overhead tiles). If you can now see the border around the animation, you can click it and delete it as any other tile.
> 2. Check the Sequencer Effect Manager tool here [insert image]
> 3. How to reset Sequencer flags [insert link]
